 I am pursuing my Masters in Big Data Science from Queen Mary University of London and looking for a full time position as an ML Engineer. I am passionate about coding and love to learn new technologies & skills. I also like to draw, paint & create handmade cards which just helps me relax. 


MSc Dissertation: Build a content-based recommendation system from scratch that recommends ideal candidates based on their skills for a particular job description. 

My previous projects revolved around solving classification & segmentation problems.
